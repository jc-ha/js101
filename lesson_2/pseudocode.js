/* a function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

Get a collection of integers
Determine how many integers are in collection
Recognize that each integer has a numerical index position
Declare a variable newArr that is assigned an empty array
Iterate over elements in the array
  Check the index of each element
  If index number is not odd, then move that element into newArr
Return newArr */
